Description of dataset:

Labour movement refers to employees in and out of employment.  In Singapore, labour movement is measured by Average monthly Recruitment/Resignation rate quarterly.Recruitment and Resignation rates provide an indication of the state of labour market and economy in a country. The change in employment sheds light on the impact of economic changes on the labour market. In particular, the breakdown of employment by different industry helps us identify industry where employment is growing or falling.
